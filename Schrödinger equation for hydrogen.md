We are gonna start with the radial equation:
$$(-{\frac{\hbar}{2m}}  \frac{d^2}{dr^{2}} - \frac{Ze^2}{r})u = Eu$$
this is the radial equation, it's like the  Schrodinger's equation for a variable u almnd the wave function was $\frac{u}{r\Psi lm}$ .
So the wave function would be as such:
$$\Psi(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{U(r)}{r}Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$$
