in this small 10 minute section of that hour and half section, initially he spoke about what would happen if you expose people to the things that they are avoiding.

#### If you expose people to the things that they are avoiding

	You know, if you take people (and I've told you this), and you expose them voluntarily
	to things that they are avoiding and are afraid of, you know,
	that they KNOW they need to overcome - in order to meet their goals, their self-defined goals.
	If you can teach people to stand up in the face of the things they're afraid of, they get stronger.
	And you don't know what the upper limits to that are.
	Because you might ask yourself, like:
	"If for 10 years, if you didn't avoid doing what you knew you needed to do,(By your own definitions, right? Within the value structure that you've created),
	to the degree that you've done that, what would you be like?"
	Well, you know, there are remarkable people who come into the world from time to time;
	and they're people who do find out over decades long periods,
	what they could be like, if they were, who they truly were. 


In conclusion to that he said: 

	And so, you could say: "well in part, perhaps the reason that you're suffering unbearably
	can be left at your feet, because you're not everything you could be, and you know it." And of course, that's a terrible thing to admit, and it's a terrible thing to consider. But there's real promise in it, right?
